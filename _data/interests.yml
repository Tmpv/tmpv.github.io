  description: Reading is a big part of my life, as it helps me not only to relax and brighten my horizons. Fiction pulls me into a other worlds, worlds often very different from our own, worlds with interesting people and creatures, just worlds, which we can experience only through our imagination. And living through those stories, we learn how to better perceive our own lifes. Nonfictional books are also important, they teach us how are own world is structured and how other real people deal with problems, some big, some small. Combining the knowledge I think makes us better people.
