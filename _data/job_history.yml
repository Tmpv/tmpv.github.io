  description: Developing and supporting a RTB system(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding) in the advertisement business. Our project was handling a lot of traffic and our main job was to keep the system stable, with low latency responses. I was involved both in developing new features for the business and also working on the infrastructure around the applications. Our main applications ware written in Node.js and this is the main technology, that we used for all our backend projects. We used a lot Redis to store some of our data, as it is really fast(but it also has it's drawbacks). An other task that we somewhat managed was to move the project to a docker environment. As a whole I was involved in most of the aspects of the project, except the some of our frontend dashboards(although I was writing the backend for them). We ware also experimenting with ElasticSearch to handle the big amount of data incoming into the system, but this yielded mixed results. Overall it was an interesting project with a lot of variety in the problems, that we needed to solve. Here I learned quite a lot from the things that we did right and the mistakes, that we made.

  company: Tradeo.com
  description: I was working on a Ruby on Rails application, but on a greater scale as my previous projects. Our application was a social trader platform. You could sign up and trade on the FOREX marked and also check, how other people are trading and learn from them. Here, working with some really good coders, learned a lot of best practices of the programming world. The whole application stack consisted of a big monolithic rails application, a line of in-house micro(written in NodeJS and Golang) and third party service integrations. We also had mobile application, which pulled data from the monolith, using a JSON API. I was mostly working on the rails application and problems related with it, but I had to write a few microservices solving in-house problems. We had a decant code review procedure and height code standards. Also it was a delight to work with such wonderful people, as everybody was friendly and ready to help. But after some time our team started to disperse and I decided to follow.

  description: During this period I worked on a startup, aiming to develop smart power switches. I worked on a web page, witch had to manage profile information and admin the power switch devises. A ruby(rack) microservices accepted data from the devices and also could send commands to them, this way switching the power switch on/off. During this period I also helped as an assistant in a programmer ruby course we did for people with small technical background, who wanted to take up programming.

  company: Insurance software technologies
  description: This was my first work as a professional developer. Our application was a Ruby on Rails project and we did all the work related with developing and supporting such a project(developing, testing, deploying, etc). The product was a web platform for car insurance brokers. The main feature of the software was the ability to compare insurance policy prices of different insurance company. It did this by taking the parameters of a vehicle and send this info to the insurance companies using their API's. The hard work was to integrate those API's into our system as they ware quite outdated and most of them ware not so good documented. Our team consisted of at first of three and then five coders, mostly inexperienced and we did some of things on the trail and error principle. I did learn a lot from our mistakes, but we also did a lot of things right, we had a decent build and deploy process(although we lacked testing) and the product was stable.
