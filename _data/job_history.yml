  description: I was working on a Ruby on Rails application, but on a greater scale as my previous projects. Our application was a social trader platform, you could sign up and trade on the FOREX marked and also check, how other people ware trading and learn from them. Here, working with some really good coders, learned a lot of best practices off the programming world. The whole application stack consisted of a big monolith rails app, a line of in-house micro(written in NODJS and Golang) and third party service integrations. We also had mobile application, which pulled data from the monolith, using a JSON API. My work was mostly tied to the this monolith and problems related with it, but I had to write a few microservices solving in-house problems. We had a decant code review procedure and height code quality standards. Also it was a delight to work with such wonderful people, as everybody was friendly and ready to help. But after some time our team started to disperse and I decided to follow.

- position: Software developer
  company: Insurance software technologies
  description: This was my first work as a professional developer. Our application was a Ruby on Rails project and we did all the work related with developing and supporting such a project(developing, testing, deploying, etc). The product was a web platform for car insurance brokers. The main feature of the software was the ability to compare insurance policies prices of different insurance company. It did this by taking the parameters of a vehicle and send this info to the insurance companies using their API's. The hard work was to integrate those API's into our system as they ware quite outdated and most of them ware not so good documented. Our team consisted of at first of three and then five coders, mostly inexperienced and we did some of things on the trail and error principle. I did learn a lot from our mistakes, but we also did a lot of things right, we had a decent build and deploy process(although we lacked testing) and the product was stable.
