<p class="mt-2"> * I have written in a few other languages, used a lot of other frameworks and technologies(python, elixir, react, sinatra, rack, docker, kubernetes and others) and I do wish to learn more new things. I don't list them as skills, as I don't consider them the best developed tools in my belt.</p>

<p class="mt-2">** Also I work primary with unix-based systems and probably won't soon switch to windows as my working machine any time soon.</p>
